## An old instant message program, written in 2012
This small application is written by me in 2012, just for practice use. Many designs are not good, since every time when I met a problem, I tried  to solve it in my own way. However, it is a good practice, since it has everything a normal client should have: it has a server, it will send email to verify user's email, it stored encrypted passwords in database, and it will send recovery letter to user to reset passwords.
- Server located in Server/, written in C, designed to run in a Linux system.
- Main part of code in winclient.cpp, implemented in C with Windows API. I didn't use MFC since I'm trying to understand how Windows API works.
  - Thus contains a lot of nonsense lines, making winclient.cpp somewhat large
- Other files are resources, or files generated by Visual Studio.
